# Anton's AI Field Kit

This is a living repo of examples and recipes to build real-world AI/LLM tools with Python.

The focus is on functional patterns that help create robust and flexible tools across a variety of use-cases.

There is a rough order in terms of how advanced each example is, but you can also browse pick-and-pluck style for functionality you might require.

Enjoy! 🚀
